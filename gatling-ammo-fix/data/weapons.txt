	description "This simple cartridge is the ammunition for the Gatling Gun, with a projectile core of depleted nuclear fuel or an illuminated tracer round. Since this ammunition is manufactured basically everywhere in galaxy - using any available materials and in varied working conditions - muzzle velocity can vary by up to 30%, and tracer distribution is seldom uniform."
